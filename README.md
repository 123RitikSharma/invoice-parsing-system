# üìÑ Custom Invoice Parsing System (Java-based)

## üß© Overview

This project is a **Custom Invoice Parsing System** developed in Java, designed to extract structured data from invoices in various formats and convert it into clean, structured **JSON output**. The system supports parsing of PDFs, Word documents (DOC/DOCX), plain text (TXT), and scanned image formats (JPG, PNG), and includes OCR support for image-based invoices.

This solution was developed by **Ritik Sharma** as a part of a 1-week assignment challenge, focusing on:
- Clean custom parsing (no online parsing libraries)
- Multiformat handling
- High-performance processing
- Scalable and robust architecture

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Build a Java-based custom parser to extract structured invoice data.
- Output the parsed data in JSON format.
- Support multiple file types with OCR for image-based invoices.
- Ensure robust error handling, logging, and multithreading support.
- Provide APIs to upload invoices and retrieve parsed data.

## üß† Key Features

### 1. Invoice Input
- Accepts single or bulk uploads via:
  - Folder-based watcher
  - REST API endpoint

### 2. Parsing Logic
- **PDF:** Apache PDFBox
- **Word Docs:** Apache POI
- **TXT:** Custom regex-based logic
- Extracts fields:
  - Invoice Number, Date
  - Vendor & Buyer Info
  - Line Items (description, quantity, unit price, total price)
  - Subtotal, Tax, Discounts, Total Amount
  - Payment Terms

### 3. OCR for Scanned Images
- Uses Tesseract OCR engine
- Preprocessing includes:
  - Deskewing
  - Binarization
  - Noise reduction

### 4. JSON Output Example
